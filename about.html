			Ruth's Garden is an inviting oasis that is a perfect venue for any life event.Â Ruth Waggoner has loved and supported animals her whole life. When given the opportunity to help the Animal League of Gaston County, she very generously donated funding to build this magnificent garden.  Ruth's Garden features a beautiful Millstone  fountain that is surrounded by engraved bricks that are available for purchase in memory or honor of a beloved pet, friend, or family member. The garden features a majestic pavillion that is perfect for an event. 

		Not only can you buy a brick, but you can buy a paver, or even better, sponsor elements of the garden, such as stone benches, the pavilion,  the butterfly garden, and trees to name a few.

		

		We hope you will allow us to host your next exciting and memorable event.</p>
